"""
Generate ToolShield multi-turn attacks targeting SHADE Arena environments.

This script bypasses the MCP inspector and feeds SHADE Arena's tool descriptions
directly into ToolShield's tree_generation pipeline.

Requires: pip install git+https://github.com/CHATS-lab/ToolShield.git

Usage:
    # Generate attacks for the banking environment
    export TOOLSHIELD_MODEL_NAME="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5"
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"   # or any LiteLLM-supported provider key

    python -m Baseline.attack_gen.generate_shade_attacks \
        --shade-root /path/to/SHADE_Arena \
        --env banking \
        --output-dir output/shade_attacks/banking

    # Generate for all environments
    python -m Baseline.attack_gen.generate_shade_attacks \
        --shade-root /path/to/SHADE_Arena \
        --output-dir output/shade_attacks

    # Generate only the safety tree + tasks (no execution needed)
    python -m Baseline.attack_gen.generate_shade_attacks \
        --shade-root /path/to/SHADE_Arena \
        --env banking \
        --output-dir output/shade_attacks/banking \
